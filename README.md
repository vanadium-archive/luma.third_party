This repository contains three kinds of code used in the Vanadium
project:

1) code which originated outside of Google
2) code which Google has released as open source
3) Vanadium code which is derived from code that originated outside of
   Google, and is therefore still subject to that original code's
   third-party license

Most of the code under third-party is open source, though some
packages have restrictive commercial licenses.
